Task: 
    A machine has 16-bit virtual addresses. Pages are 8 KB. How
    many entries are needed for a single-level linear page table?
    Explain your computations. Save your answer to ex6.txt

1) 8 Kb = 2^3 Kb = 2^3 * 2^10 bit = 2^13 bit
2) So, we have machine, which has 16-bit virtual addresses => 16 - 13 = 3 bit
3) In 3 bit we can store 2^3 = 8 entries
