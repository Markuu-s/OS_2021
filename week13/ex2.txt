Recovery:
This approach allows processes to deadlock, and then
periodically check whether there is a deadlock in the system or not.
If this happens, then it applies some recovery methods to
the system.

Prevention:
A deadlock occurs only after mutual alienation.
Prevetion more effective than recovery.

Avoidance:
Advantage: safe completion of the process. The process continues as long as the system is in a safe
state. The OS should return one step when the safe state ends. To do this, you need to have a lot of information
about each process, which leads to less efficiency.

Avoidance more safety than other.
But recovery more effective than Avoidance.
